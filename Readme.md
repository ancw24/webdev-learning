# The Collection

This repository contains all the information that I collected to teach students to become a web developer using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  
Students can read more about a specific topic, repeat things learned before, look at exercises that have been done or find useful resources like links.

## The Structure

There are 3 main categories of this repository, that will be used to store information.
